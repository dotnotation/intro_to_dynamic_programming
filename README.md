Dynamic Programming
    - A method for solving a complex problem by breaking it down into a collection of simpler subproblems, solving each of those subproblems just once, and storing their solution
    - by Richard Bellman
    - dynamic meaning to capture the time-varying aspect of the problems
    - both a mathematical optimization method and a computer programming method
    - can only use when there is an optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems
